# ffnpeg

Bash script containing common ffmpeg usages so I don't have to keep looking them up.

## Installation

Just copy or link `ffnpeg` to your `$PATH`.

## Usage

Run with `-h` to get usage info.

```sh
ffnpeg -h
```

ffnpeg contains several subcommands.
You can run `-h` with those subcommands to get usage info for them.

## Known Bugs

I'm pretty sure the `split` and `trim` commands don't work properly, 
and at this point I don't have any intent of fixing them.
(I wrote this script and didn't touch it for a year and now I have no idea how any of it works.)
Just don't use those commands I guess.
